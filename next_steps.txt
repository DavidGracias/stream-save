Manage
8. allow manage to somehow use "user" as info as well (I think this is part of the metadata)
9. auto hide/show information for the given user only (togglable views for admin, but need to click button -- no passwords or anything like that tho, just like an eyeball icon with a hand over it / x over it for "hide/show")


Later:
include multiple user types on this page -- and that can be updated via the urls as well. Default to localhost
add urls based off of user (localhost = default, rest = render.on url)
Let filtering of users be the default
Update directory to discluse unneeded files






ADD HOME SCREEN gentle message/modal (on any click closes it) that requests you use my Torbox referral code
POST to github for the world to see
make sure the readme is clear & updated
give HUGE HUGE credit to original git repo
note that if they want a much simpler UI, go to: previous github but note that this repository was last updated 2023, and has some slight issues, which was why I created this repo! Hope everyone likes!
